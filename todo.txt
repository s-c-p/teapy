enforce types in appState

why do i have to repeat myself, is it possible (just asking)
	that fns automatically fill in the callers globals n locals
	without me having to fill those

? remove default from tea.switch_case.switch, it is redundant
	since all cases are msg derivatives and all must be handled

message choice in argument list of tea.msgFactory.msgType
	but than i'll have to track for clashes
